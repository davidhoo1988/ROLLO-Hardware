2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-4#1 Warning
Shallow depth for a dedicated block RAM  
The instance mem_E/mem_reg_0 is implemented as block RAM but is better mapped onto distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The depth (1 address bits) is shallow. Please use attribute (* ram_style = "distributed" *)  to instruct Vivado to infer distributed LUT RAM.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-4#2 Warning
Shallow depth for a dedicated block RAM  
The instance mem_E/mem_reg_1 is implemented as block RAM but is better mapped onto distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The depth (1 address bits) is shallow. Please use attribute (* ram_style = "distributed" *)  to instruct Vivado to infer distributed LUT RAM.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-4#3 Warning
Shallow depth for a dedicated block RAM  
The instance mem_E/mem_reg_12 is implemented as block RAM but is better mapped onto distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The depth (1 address bits) is shallow. Please use attribute (* ram_style = "distributed" *)  to instruct Vivado to infer distributed LUT RAM.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-4#4 Warning
Shallow depth for a dedicated block RAM  
The instance mem_E/mem_reg_2 is implemented as block RAM but is better mapped onto distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The depth (1 address bits) is shallow. Please use attribute (* ram_style = "distributed" *)  to instruct Vivado to infer distributed LUT RAM.
Related violations: <none>
